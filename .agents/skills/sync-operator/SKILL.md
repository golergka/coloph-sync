name: sync-operator
description: Operate and continuously supervise the sync coordinator in its designated checkout, including recovery and operator reminders. Contributors use sync-contributor or sync-finish.
---

Operate only the checkout where the sync coordinator runs, with repository authorization.
That checkout is reserved for merging branches, running checks, and delivery.
A feature or bug-fix request does not authorize contributor edits there.
If asked to make such a change there, explain its role and ask the user to assign the task to a contributor checkout.
Proceed there only if the user explicitly authorizes contributor edits in that checkout; then use `sync-contributor`.
Invoking this skill in that checkout authorizes normal coordinator operations, including starting or resuming it.
Do not ask for additional approval for operations within these worktree boundaries.
Explicit user authorization is required only for an exception to those boundaries.
Contributor worktrees belong to their assigned agents. Never inspect, modify, enter, or operate their files or processes.
Use branch refs, coordinator status, and merge results to integrate their work. A conflict belongs to the worktree owner.
Do not create or switch worktrees. Access to another checkout requires explicit user authorization.
Approval for the integration checkout does not grant access to contributor worktrees.
## Start and supervise

On invocation, start or resume continuous operation unless the user requests inspection, stopping, or a single cycle.
Check the current checkout, configured main branch, clean working tree, and project prerequisites before starting.
Read the project's check and delivery instructions. Do not substitute weaker checks or deployment procedures.
Check for an existing coordinator in this checkout before starting another instance.
Keep a healthy existing instance. The shared repository lock prevents concurrent coordinators.
Never start a separate deployment alongside the coordinator.

Run `uv run coloph-sync run` in the foreground. A terminal multiplexer or service manager can host it.
Keep the exact terminal session or service identity so you can supervise that instance.
If a tool wait times out, check the same instance before restarting. A tool timeout does not prove process exit.
For detached operation, use the project's launcher or a terminal multiplexer without attaching to it.
Use the project's sleep-prevention mechanism on hosts that can sleep. Do not duplicate an existing sleep assertion.

## Operator reminder

Before ending a turn with continuous operation active, create or reuse a recurring operator reminder on this task.
Use the host's automation tool. Default to every 15 minutes unless the user specifies another interval.
Check existing reminders first. Keep only one operator reminder for this task and checkout.
Check the saved reminder's task destination, checkout, schedule, and instructions after creation or update.
If reminders are unavailable, keep supervising the foreground session and report that limitation.
Do not end supervision merely because one cycle succeeded or delivery is still pending.

Include these instructions in the reminder, with the actual task, checkout, and process or service identity:

> Created for agent/task: <operator task and checkout>.
> Load `sync-operator` at every wakeup. Supervise only this checkout's coordinator.
> Check the owned instance, `uv run coloph-sync status --all`, and `uv run coloph-sync logs`.
> If the instance is absent unexpectedly or has a new failure, follow the recovery instructions in this skill.
> Respect the latest user stop request. Never restart after that request.
> Preserve worktree boundaries and existing repair authorization.
> Report state changes and actionable failures. Stay quiet while healthy or while an unchanged repair continues.
> Continue until the user stops operation or a concrete blocker prevents recovery.

An operator reminder supervises the service continuously. It does not expire after an individual branch deploys.
If a wakeup targets another task or checkout, do not operate that checkout.
Report the routing mismatch instead of executing unrelated instructions.

## Stop and recover

Use `uv run coloph-sync stop` to finish the current cycle and prevent another cycle.
On a user stop request, delete the operator reminder so it cannot restart the loop.
Check that the saved reminder is gone. Wait for the owned process to exit before reporting it stopped.
Do not edit files or run mutating Git commands while the coordinator owns the checkout.
Read `uv run coloph-sync logs` and `uv run coloph-sync status --all` for evidence.

A failed cycle stops the loop. Investigate its recorded phase and output.
Branch conflicts and invalid metadata leave that branch out; other eligible branches continue.
Check failures stop the cycle. Contributor conflicts belong to their branch owners.
The coordinator merges branches into the configured main branch. It never merges main back into contributor worktrees.
For persistent branch failures, inspect branch refs and commit intent, then report the conflict to the branch owner.
A deployment barrier can delay successors while its parent deploys. This is pending work, not a failure.
Do not bypass a barrier or move coordination refs to admit its successors.

Diagnose failed checks through the project's prescribed workflow. Never skip or weaken a check to continue.
For an authorized contributor repair here, stop the coordinator and use `sync-contributor`.
Create a normal checked repair commit before resuming. Never leave an uncommitted repair for the loop to collect.
Without that repair authorization, report the required contributor work and the responsible checkout.
After a coordinator repair, keep the continuous loop stopped. Record `uv run coloph-sync --json status --all`, then run exactly one `uv run coloph-sync run --once`. This recovery cycle performs its one delivery attempt before normal looping resumes; do not run another deploy command or start the continuous loop alongside it. If that cycle fails, recover the new recorded failure instead of re-enabling the loop.
After that recovery cycle succeeds, compare `uv run coloph-sync --json status --all` with the saved pre-recovery status. Identify every branch newly reported as deployed and every branch with a newly recorded rejection or `action needed` result. When operating in Codex, find the task responsible for each identified branch from its confirmed branch assignment or task history, then send that task: `The coordinator failed, but was fixed. Your branch has been deployed.` or `The coordinator failed, but was fixed. Your branch has been rejected.` Do not guess a task-branch association or message an unrelated task; report an unassigned branch instead.
Only after this notification pass, resume normal continuous operation unless the user requested a single cycle or stopped operation.
After three failed repair attempts for the same cause, report the blocker and stop automatic retries.
Delete the operator reminder when recovery requires unavailable input or new authority.

Report push failures, including failures that recover. Retry a transient network failure once.
For authentication or non-fast-forward failures, report the concrete error. Never force-push or rewrite history to continue.
Report deployment failures even if recovery is possible. A failed deployment can leave remote changes in place.
Use the project's recovery procedure to reconcile remote work before retrying.
An interrupted external operation may already have taken effect. Resume through the same coordinator so the configured project command can reconcile it; do not start a competing delivery operation or move coordinator-owned refs manually.
Use `uv run coloph-sync run --push-deploy-only` only to check and deliver the current integration branch without admitting worktree branches; it does not replace the one recovery cycle above.
The coordinator does not resolve conflicts or perform automatic rollback.
